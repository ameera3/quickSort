## Usage

## Introduction

The command line program quickSort.cpp first reads the file QuickSort.txt, which contains the integers 1 
through 10000 inclusive in some unsorted order. The program outputs the number of comparisons made depending 
on the choice of pivot.

Option 1: pivot is always the first element in the array.

Option 2: pivot is always the last element in the array.

Option 3: pivot is always the median of the first, last, and middle elements of the array.
